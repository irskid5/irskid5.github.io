Hi! I'm Vele. You've hit my personal website where I talk about my passions and showcase some of my achievements in life. 

I am a machine learning engineer focusing on application. My passion is to apply machine learning to real-world problems. I also believe in privacy and security, which is why I've chosen to currently specialize in `privacy-preserving machine learning` using `fully homomorphic encryption` (FHE).

I recently completed my MASc from the University of Toronto (Nov. 2023) and have been working at [Lorica Cybersecurity](https://www.loricacyber.com/) as a software engineer on the machine learning team since 2020.

This website is still under construction! For more current information, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veletosevski/).
