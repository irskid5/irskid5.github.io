Hi! I'm Vele. You've hit my personal website where I talk about my passions and showcase some of my achievements in life. 

I am a machine learning engineer, currently specializing in `privacy-preserving machine learning` using `fully homomorphic encryption` (FHE). 

I'm in the process of creating this website! For more current information, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veletosevski/).
